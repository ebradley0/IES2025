 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR235x Demo - Toggle P1.0 using software
//
//  Description: Toggle P1.0 every 0.1s using software.
//  By default, FR235x select XT1 as FLL reference.
//  If XT1 is present, the PxSEL(XIN & XOUT) needs to configure.
//  If XT1 is absent, switch to select REFO as FLL reference automatically.
//  XT1 is considered to be absent in this example.
//  ACLK = default REFO ~32768Hz, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCODIV ~1MHz.
